# learning-projects

I have a bad habit of just wiping machines without backing up things that I don't remember I have. Usually not a big deal, but this repo will make a good reference for whatever reasons might pop-up.

I'll probably just be commiting all from this workspace since it's just for this and that. As a result silly things like HelloWorlds from new languages I'm picking up will likely make their way in.
